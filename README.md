### 🔁 `Loops-Files`

Contains problems and solutions that demonstrate the use of various looping constructs (e.g., `for`, `while`, `do-while`). Ideal for mastering iterative programming logic.

### 🎨 `Patterns`

Includes pattern-printing programs (pyramids, diamonds, etc.) that help improve logic-building and nested loop handling skills.

### 🔄 `Recursion-Files`

Comprises exercises and examples that showcase the use of recursion, a core concept for solving problems like factorials, Fibonacci series, and backtracking challenges.
